## Introduction to Techs

Mybrary is a small application built on the MongoDB, Express, Node, EJS. MongoDB was chosen as the Database Management System (DBMS). 

Mongoose will be used with our MongoDB implementation, it is an Object Data Modelling (ODM) library for use with MongoDB and Node.js. It assists in managing the relationships between data, provides schema validation and is used to translate between objects in Node.js code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
